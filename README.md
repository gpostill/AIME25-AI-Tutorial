## Case Study: Clinical Scenario  
 
ROTEM (Rotational Thromboelastometry) is a point-of-care diagnostic tool used to assess blood coagulation in real time. It measures the viscoelastic properties of whole blood as it clots and breaks down, providing dynamic insights into clot formation, strength, and dissolution. ROTEM is especially useful in managing bleeding and guiding transfusion decisions in trauma, surgery, and critical care settings. Unlike traditional lab-based coagulation tests, ROTEM offers faster, more comprehensive information on the entire clotting process, including contributions from platelets, fibrinogen, and clot lysis. 

In the context of traumatic injuries this is very important as massive hemorrhage is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. In trauma care, rapid and accurate assessment of a patient’s coagulation status is thus critical. Specifically, many severely injured patients develop trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC)—a complex condition involving bleeding and impaired clot formation—which significantly increases the risk of death if not quickly recognized and treated.

Clinicians in trauma bays must make rapid, high-stakes decisions based on ROTEM results, often in environments with limited time, personnel, and cognitive bandwidth. There is an urgent need for an intuitive, intelligent user interface (UI) that streamlines ROTEM interpretation, enhances decision-making, and integrates seamlessly into the trauma workflow.

**Why Use Machine Learning to Automate ROTEM Output Interpretation?**
Using machine learning (ML) to automate ROTEM interpretation offers several potential benefits:
1.	Timely and Objective Decision Support
ROTEM produces complex, high-dimensional data (e.g., curves, multiple parameters like CT, CFT, MCF, ML). ML can quickly interpret these patterns to provide real-time, standardized decision support—crucial in time-sensitive settings such as trauma resuscitation or massive transfusion protocols.
2.	Reducing Variability
Human interpretation of ROTEM can vary by clinician experience. ML offers consistent, reproducible interpretations and can act as a second reader to reduce errors.
3.	Prediction of Clinical Resources Needed
ML models can be trained to predict clinical outcomes (e.g., need for transfusion, mortality, risk of rebleeding) based on ROTEM data combined with clinical variables, supporting early intervention and resource allocation.

## Design Challenge

**Your Task:**
Design a user interface that supports clinicians in interpreting ROTEM results in real-time during trauma resuscitation. Your interface should aim to:
- Simplify and clearly communicate key ROTEM parameters (e.g., CT, CFT, MCF, ML)
- Provide actionable insights (e.g., "consider fibrinogen", "risk of hyperfibrinolysis")
- Minimize cognitive load and support fast decisions under pressure
- Be usable across different roles in the trauma bay (e.g., trauma surgeon, anesthesiologist, transfusion specialist)
- Optionally integrate machine learning outputs to aid interpretation or prediction

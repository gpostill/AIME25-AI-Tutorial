# Creating Deployable AI in Heatlthcare
*A tutorial for the AIME 2025 Conference*

Welcome to the official site for our AIME 2025 tutorial!

##  Rationale and Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into healthcare, yet many AI models fail to transition from research to real-world deployment. This gap often arises due to misalignment with clinical needs, lack of transparency, and poor integration into clinical workflows. To bridge this divide, AI models must be explainable, actionable, and designed with the clinical need and end-users in mind.

This tutorial addresses the critical need for clinically oriented, explainable AI (XAI) in healthcare, equipping participants with the skills to develop models that clinicians can trust and use. AI adoption in medicine requires models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide interpretable insights that align with medical decision-making. Without transparency, even high-performing models risk rejection by healthcare providers due to concerns about reliability, bias, and ethical implications. Furthermore, clinical workflows operate within specific time constraints, requiring AI models that use available information and provide timely predictions within an appropriate decision-making window.

This session will guide participants through the key considerations in developing deployable AI, from selecting the right model to integrating multi-model dashboards for enhanced and practical clinical decision support. By fostering collaboration between clinicians and data scientists, this tutorial aims to promote the development of AI solutions that are not only innovative but also practical, explainable, and clinically impactful.


## Tutorial Topics

This tutorial will explore the following topics:
- **Identifying an actionable clinical need** â€“ Learn how to define AI problems that address real-world clinical challenges and provide measurable impact on patient care.
- **Determining the modeling time-window for clinical workflow** â€“ Explore how to align predictive modeling with clinical decision-making timelines (recognizing when and how information is available) to ensure timely and useful AI outputs.
- **Selecting an appropriate AI model** â€“ Understand how to choose AI models that balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and feasibility for clinical deployment.
- **Explainable AI** â€“ Discover key techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations to enhance transparency and trust in AI-driven healthcare decisions. Consider how these insights can and should be communicated to clinical stakeholders.
- **Clinician-facing model interfaces** â€“ Learn best practices for designing AI tools that integrate seamlessly into clinician workflows, ensuring usability and adoption.
- **Thinking big with multi-model departmental dashboards** â€“ Explore how to develop AI-driven dashboards for clinical departments that combine multiple models and data streams for comprehensive clinical decision support. Recognize the value in beginning these consultation processes prior to development/deployment of an individual model.

**Gemma Postill**, MD/PhD Candidate, University of Toronto - As an MD/PhD Candidate, Gemma has expertise in AI applications in healthcare outcome prediction and clinical decision support. She also has expertise in medical education, having led multiple initiatives on AI literacy for healthcare professionals. Gemma is actively involved in medical education research to develop an AI competency framework, and separately a clinician scientist competency framework. Together, the research and education initiatives she leads help to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical implementation.

# Creating Deployable AI in Heatlthcare
*A tutorial for the AIME 2025 Conference*

Welcome to the official tutorial site for our AIME 2025 tutorial! 

---
##  Rationale and Overview

The increasing deployment of AI in healthcare raises critical questions about how clinicians should be trained to interact with AI-driven decision support tools. While some argue that physicians need only a conceptual understanding of AI, others believe deeper technical training is necessary to ensure safe and effective use. Similarly, for AI developers, the extent of clinical expertise required has yet to be explicitly stated; indeed, an understanding of the healthcare context is pertinent as various assumptions about clinical variables and workflows are embedded within model architectures. Providing guidelines around the types of knowledge needed by each stakeholder (hospital, clinicians, developers) is pertinent to enable interdisciplinary collaboration. Clear guidelines around the knowledge of each stakeholder is also a pre-requirement to current debates around equity and liability with deployed AI models. This topic is particularly relevant to AIME attendees, as AI literacy among healthcare professionals â€“ and health literacy among AI developers â€“ are foundational factors in determining the success of AI integration into clinical practice. 

This workshop will explore the core technical AI competencies necessary for clinicians using AI, as well as the tenants of healthcare that data scientists need to be aware of when developing AI for healthcare and health research. Through interactive discussions, case studies, and hands-on activities, participants will evaluate different AI education models, discuss legal and ethical considerations, and propose strategies fostering AI literacy among healthcare professionals.

Target audience of our workshop includes AIME attendees who are:
- Clinicians and medical educators interested in AI integration into healthcare
- AI researchers and developers, including trainees, focusing on healthcare applications
- Medical students and residents seeking AI literacy
- Policymakers and administrators designing AI education policies


## Tutorial Topics

This tutorial will explore the following topics:
- **Identifying an actionable clinical need** â€“ Learn how to define AI problems that address real-world clinical challenges and provide measurable impact on patient care.
- **Determining the modeling time-window for clinical workflow** â€“ Explore how to align predictive modeling with clinical decision-making timelines (recognizing when and how information is available) to ensure timely and useful AI outputs.
- **Selecting an appropriate AI model** â€“ Understand how to choose AI models that balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and feasibility for clinical deployment.
- **Explainable AI** â€“ Discover key techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations to enhance transparency and trust in AI-driven healthcare decisions. Consider how these insights can and should be communicated to clinical stakeholders.
- **Clinician-facing model interfaces** â€“ Learn best practices for designing AI tools that integrate seamlessly into clinician workflows, ensuring usability and adoption.
- **Thinking big with multi-model departmental dashboards** â€“ Explore how to develop AI-driven dashboards for clinical departments that combine multiple models and data streams for comprehensive clinical decision support. Recognize the value in beginning these consultation processes prior to development/deployment of an individual model.

**Gemma Postill**, MD/PhD Candidate, University of Toronto - As an MD/PhD Candidate, Gemma has expertise in AI applications in healthcare outcome prediction and clinical decision support. She also has expertise in medical education, having led multiple initiatives on AI literacy for healthcare professionals. Gemma is actively involved in medical education research to develop an AI competency framework, and separately a clinician scientist competency framework. Together, the research and education initiatives she leads help to bridge the gap between AI development and real-world clinical implementation.
